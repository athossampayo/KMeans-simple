# KMeans-simple
Simple ipynb for testing and demonstrating scikit-learn KMeans clusterization algorithm and finding the Optimal Cluster Number
<br>
### This notebook:
* :card_file_box: generates a dataset with make_blobs and runs and plots KMeans with 1 and 5 clusters.
* :rocket: creates a function for finding the optimal cluster number then runs and plots KMeans with it.
